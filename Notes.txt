If you want your ACF-powered vehicle to go at realistic speeds, put the following code in your server's server.cfg configuration file
or run this command in the GMod game console

lua_run local tbl = physenv.GetPerformanceSettings() tbl.MaxAngularVelocity = 30000 physenv.SetPerformanceSettings(tbl)
lua_run local tbl = physenv.GetPerformanceSettings() tbl.MaxVelocity = 20000 physenv.SetPerformanceSettings(tbl)

When installing, please install in the ACF folder via Addons folder in the GMod game directory ie:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\ACF for computers running Windows
By default GMod is located on the C drive in windows however if you installed GMod on a different drive or on other operating systems ie
Linux or macOS, note the directory:
steamapps\common\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons\ACF
When using SVN please set output to said directory
When using Zip archive process extract the contents in the folder in the Zip archive (NOT the folder itself) to the said directory
